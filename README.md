# Morseco - The Morse code IoT station 

It has been years since Morse code was the main telecommunication method. With Morseco, communicating with friends on chatroom no longer a boring task of typing the text on smartphone, but an interactive and fun experience for people who love the old school technology. Plus, for people who want to learn Morse code, this is a good tools to memorize complex combination of dash and dot. Morseco also provides a bonus of a real time internet-updated clock, so that you never need to fiddle with the code to switch time when day time saving comes. Everytime you start the machine, fun LED and Star Wars music create butterfly in your stomach. Oh the good old time! 

In a nutshell, this is a Morse code communication system which automatically translate morse code between an Arduino station and Telegram chat bot. 

## Motivation

## Functionality

## Components and Supplies

* 1 Arduino MKR1000 board
* 1 micro USB cable
* 1 400-point breadboard
* 3 pushbuttons (for dot, dash, and space)
* 3 10k ohm resistor for button pull down resistors
* 1 alphanumeric LCD (16 x 2 characters)
* a 220 Ohm resistor for LCD
* 1 RGB LED
* 1 buzzer

Pin connection can be infered from the code.
